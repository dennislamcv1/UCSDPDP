    "\n",
    "*An Introduction to Statistical Learning* introduces supervised learning as \"building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an *output* based on one or more *inputs*\". This is the core difference between supervised and unsupervised learning; in unsupervised learning, there is no direct output, but we can still learn about relationships and structures in the data. As a general rule of thumb, we tend to refer to problems with a *quantitative response* as regression problems, while those involving a *qualitative response* are often referred to as classification problems. The type(s) of predictors are not usually that important when making this distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we were introduced to the concept of supervised learning. We then learned about regression and how we can do this in Python. In this notebook, we will go over basic linear regression (through library and manual approaches) and autoregression as shown in lecture videos."

Recall from the \"Supervised Learning: Regression\" lecture that the general form of a linear regression model is $$X\\theta = y$$ where we need to solve for $\\theta$. We do so by multiplying each side of the formula with the inverse of the multiplication of X-transposed and X, or $(X^TX)^{-1}$. We are left with $$\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$$ as seen below.
