    "1. **Training datasets** form the basis of a model's learning, teaching it how to estimate its output.\n",
    "2. **Validation datasets** check the accuracy, quality, and integrity of a model, as well as fine-tuning any parameters that are not directly optimized.\n",
    "3. **Test datasets** are usually what we are most interested in -- how does the model perform with previously unseen data that reflects real-world cases?\n",
